# internet-speed-checker

This Python script tests the speed of your internet connection and notes the value down in an Excel sheet.
Please note that the Excel sheet present in this repo must be used and placed in the same folder as the Python script to avoid formatting clashes while storing test results.

Required Python packages:<br>
--> `speedtest-cli`<br>
--> `openpyxl`

This script may be automated using Windows Task Manager in order to get test results for multiple instances.
